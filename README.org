#+TITLE: Wire Cell Exchange Data in ROOT format

This package provides data structures for exchanging data in ROOT format between Wire Cell and other systems.

This package is independent from Wire Cell Toolkit (and Prototype).

* Identifiers

Identifiers (variables ending in =id=) are:

- unsigned,
- unique within the implicit context of the data,
- take value of zero to indicate "undefined",
- and otherwise take values which are application-dependent.

* Coordinate system

The coordinate system is application-dependent.

* Classes

The classes in this package are meant to describe information about wire-cell type imaging and reconstruction.  
They are designed to preserve associations given ROOT I/O limitations.  
The design is not intended to be used directly for interactive analysis (ie, =tree->Draw(...)=).

See the comments in the header files for details of how they should be interpreted.
